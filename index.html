								<p>Object Detection & Clustering - Fall 2022: <br> For my Web Information Search and Management class, we were assigned a semester long, group project where we had to identify, cluster, and extract texts given sets of ERD Diagrams. First, we identified the objects in the diagram by their classes. Then, we extracted texts from those objects. Finally, we ran multiple clustering algorithms based on their texts. I was able to detect the objects by their classes using the Tensorflow library and implemented Kmeans++ given the text files outputs.<br>This was my first big project using Python, different libraries, and Jupyter Notebook. I learned more about deep learning than I've ever had and became very comfortable with Python. With the freedom I was given, I was also able to select what methods or algorithms to implement to improve the overall accuracy and the runtime. </a>.</p>
								<p>Personal Website - Summer 2022: <br>  Welcome to my website! Although I have done few projects for classes and in groups, this is a project that I personally started with no organizational guidance. I figured this would help my understanding of HTML and JavaScript since my experiences with those tools are limited.</p>
								<p>Chess Game - Fall 2021:<br>  Three other students and I created a chess game that mimicked chess.com. The game could save users' informations, their records, and their progress in any chess game that they have played. We also gave them points depending on their records. I was in charge of creating and maintaining the database/tables using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. Additionally, I worked on the frontend and was able to display proper information using those tables.<br>This was my first time building an entire program from scratch and I learned a lot from other group members about servers, database incoporation, and even learned python. You can check out my code repository <a href="https://github.com/joshocoleman/CS348-Chess"> here </a>.</p>
								<p>Shell Interpreter - Spring 2021:<br>  In a Systems Programming class, I was able to create a program that mimicked common shells including bash and csh with wildcarding. As a sophomore in college, I created multiple processes and handled file redirection, piping, and background processes. For languages, I used C for program development, C++ for string manipulation, and Lex & Yacc for the scanner and the parser.<br>This was the hardest class project that I have encountered in my first two years at Purdue but it was a good introductory project to learn about multiple processes, Unix programming, and piping. You can check out my code repository <a href="https://github.com/joshocoleman/CS252-Shell/"> here </a>.</p>

								<p>Hi, I'm Josh and I grew up in Kokomo, IN. I was originally born in South Korea and lived there until I was 7 years old.<p>
								<p>I graduated from Purdue University in May 2023 with a BS in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Intelligence.</p>
								<p>I currently work for John Deere and am in their Engineering Developement Program. The EDP program consists of three 8 months rotations:
									<ol>
										<li> 1st rotation was as a Data Scientist where I made/manipulated data from the Data Lake and created dashboards for different engineering teams on John Deere's Automony & Automation group.</li>
										<li> 2nd rotation was as an Embedded Software Engineer where I supported and created new features for our product See & Spray.</li>
										<li> 3rd rotation will be as a Software Engineer where I will be working on API Developement for licensing while also doing embedded work with a display.</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p> My hobbies are playing golf, various club sports, playing video games, and trying different restaurants!</p>
